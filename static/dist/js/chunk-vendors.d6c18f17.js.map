This allows you to inject custom shader logic and transforms into the\n * builtin ThreeJS materials without having to recreate them from scratch.\n *\n * @param {THREE.Material} baseMaterial - the original material to derive from\n *\n * @param {Object} options - How the base material should be modified.\n * @param {Object} options.defines - Custom `defines` for the material\n * @param {Object} options.extensions - Custom `extensions` for the material, e.g. `{derivatives: true}`\n * @param {Object} options.uniforms - Custom `uniforms` for use in the modified shader. These can\n *        be accessed and manipulated via the resulting material's `uniforms` property, just like\n *        in a ShaderMaterial. You do not need to repeat the base material's own uniforms here.\n * @param {String} options.timeUniform - If specified, a uniform of this name will be injected into\n *        both shaders, and it will automatically be updated on each render frame with a number of\n *        elapsed milliseconds. The \"zero\" epoch time is not significant so don't rely on this as a\n *        true calendar time.\n * @param {String} options.vertexDefs - Custom GLSL code to inject into the vertex shader's top-level\n *        definitions, above the `void main()` function.\n * @param {String} options.vertexMainIntro - Custom GLSL code to inject at the top of the vertex\n *        shader's `void main` function.\n * @param {String} options.vertexMainOutro - Custom GLSL code to inject at the end of the vertex\n *        shader's `void main` function.\n * @param {String} options.vertexTransform - Custom GLSL code to manipulate the `position`, `normal`,\n *        and/or `uv` vertex attributes. This code will be wrapped within a standalone function with\n *        those attributes exposed by their normal names as read/write values.\n * @param {String} options.fragmentDefs - Custom GLSL code to inject into the fragment shader's top-level\n *        definitions, above the `void main()` function.\n * @param {String} options.fragmentMainIntro - Custom GLSL code to inject at the top of the fragment\n *        shader's `void main` function.\n * @param {String} options.fragmentMainOutro - Custom GLSL code to inject at the end of the fragment\n *        shader's `void main` function. You can manipulate `gl_FragColor` here but keep in mind it goes\n *        after any of ThreeJS's color postprocessing shader chunks (tonemapping, fog, etc.), so if you\n *        want those to apply to your changes use `fragmentColorTransform` instead.\n * @param {String} options.fragmentColorTransform - Custom GLSL code to manipulate the `gl_FragColor`\n *        output value. Will be injected near the end of the `void main` function, but before any\n *        of ThreeJS's color postprocessing shader chunks (tonemapping, fog, etc.), and before the\n *        `fragmentMainOutro`.\n * @param {function<{vertexShader,fragmentShader}>:{vertexShader,fragmentShader}} options.customRewriter - A function\n *        for performing custom rewrites of the full shader code. Useful if you need to do something\n *        special that's not covered by the other builtin options. This function will be executed before\n *        any other transforms are applied.\n * @param {boolean} options.chained - Set to `true` to prototype-chain the derived material to the base\n *        material, rather than the default behavior of copying it. This allows the derived material to\n *        automatically pick up changes made to the base material and its properties. This can be useful\n *        where the derived material is hidden from the user as an implementation detail, allowing them\n *        to work with the original material like normal. But it can result in unexpected behavior if not\n *        handled carefully.\n *\n * @return {THREE.Material}\n *\n * The returned material will also have two new methods, `getDepthMaterial()` and `getDistanceMaterial()`,\n * which can be called to get a variant of the derived material for use in shadow casting. If the\n * target mesh is expected to cast shadows, then you can assign these to the mesh's `customDepthMaterial`\n * (for directional and spot lights) and/or `customDistanceMaterial` (for point lights) properties to\n * allow the cast shadow to honor your derived shader's vertex transforms and discarded fragments. These\n * will also set a custom `#define IS_DEPTH_MATERIAL` or `#define IS_DISTANCE_MATERIAL` that you can look\n * for in your derived shaders with `#ifdef` to customize their behavior for the depth or distance\n * scenarios, e.g. skipping antialiasing or expensive shader logic.\n */\nfunction createDerivedMaterial(baseMaterial, options) {\n  // Generate a key that is unique to the content of these `options`.
